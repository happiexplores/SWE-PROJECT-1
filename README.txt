I’m super excited to share that I’m a part of the Headstarter AI Software Engineering Fellowship. For my first project, I built a personal website called "Project 1: Personal Website." I started with a template from HTML5 and created a personal portfolio that showcases my skills and defines me as an individual.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML, style it with CSS, and add interactivity with JavaScript. This experience has significantly boosted my confidence in frontend development.

Overall, I learned a lot from this project and I’m looking forward to tackling more projects in the future.
